      <P>Welcome to the dinner recipes section!</p>
      
      <P>To make chicken biryani, start by marinating chicken with yogurt, biryani masala, turmeric, and chili powder for 30 minutes. Cook basmati rice until 70% done in boiling water with whole spices and salt, then drain and set aside. In a pan, fry sliced onions in oil or ghee until golden, and set half aside for garnishing. Add ginger-garlic paste to the same pan, followed by the marinated chicken, chopped tomatoes, and green chilies, cooking until the chicken is tender. In a large pot, layer the partially cooked rice and chicken alternately, topping with fried onions, fresh coriander, mint, and saffron milk or food color. Seal the lid tightly and cook on low heat (dum) for 20-25 minutes. Gently mix before serving hot with raita or salad.</P>
